# FlashCard v0.5.0a #

A program to help with the study of foreign languages, with special considerations for CJK languages.

## Quick Start ##

    git clone http://github.com/brcooley/clicard.git clicard
    cd clicard
    python3 clicard.py -b Example.vraw
    python3 clicard.py Example.vocab

## Overview ##

This project has just been started, but will continue to be added to over the next several months.  Currently, only one kind of vocabulary-testing works, but the plans are to fill out the other testing features, along with implementing statistics and some basic analysis of those to suggest what words are commonly missed, etc.  If there is a feature you'd like to see, send me an email, or preferably a merge request.  Thanks.
